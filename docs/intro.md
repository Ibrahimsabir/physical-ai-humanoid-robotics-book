# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This 13-week curriculum will take you from fundamental ROS 2 concepts to building an autonomous humanoid system with Vision-Language-Action capabilities.

## About This Book

This book is structured into 5 progressive modules that build upon each other to create a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Establish communication infrastructure
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Create physics-based simulation environments
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Implement perception, navigation, and manipulation
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Connect natural language to robot actions
- **Module 5**: Capstone - Autonomous Humanoid Integration

## Learning Path

This curriculum is designed for advanced undergraduate/graduate learners with Python proficiency and basic AI/ML background, but no prior robotics experience required. By the end of this book, you will be able to:

- Design and simulate a humanoid robot
- Build ROS 2 control systems
- Perform perception, navigation, and manipulation
- Integrate LLM-based Vision-Language-Action pipelines
- Deploy AI workloads to Jetson edge devices
- Execute a full simulated humanoid capstone

## Getting Started

Begin with **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** to establish the foundational communication layer that all other modules depend on. Each module includes hands-on exercises, practical examples, and integration checkpoints to ensure you're ready to progress.

### Prerequisites

- Python proficiency
- Basic AI/ML background
- Access to a workstation with NVIDIA GPU (recommended: RTX 4080 with 16GB+ VRAM)

### Hardware & Deployment

This book covers both simulation environments and real-world deployment considerations for NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin platforms, with emphasis on sim-to-real model transfer capabilities.
