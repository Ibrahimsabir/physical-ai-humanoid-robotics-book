# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World Constitution

## Core Principles

### Specification-First Rule
No chapter, section, or example may be written without a corresponding spec. Specs define what must exist, not how it is implemented. Claude must treat specs as authoritative contracts.

### Modular Architecture
The book is divided into modules, each representing a system layer: Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2), Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac), Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA), Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid System. Each module must be self-contained, expose clear inputs, outputs, and responsibilities, and build upon previous modules without duplication.

### Physical AI First-Principles
All explanations must respect physical laws (gravity, inertia, latency), explicitly contrast digital AI vs embodied AI, and highlight real-world constraints: sensor noise, compute limits, latency, energy and hardware tradeoffs. No "magic AI" explanations are allowed.

### Simulation-to-Reality Continuity
Every simulated concept must map to real hardware, sim-to-real transfer must be discussed explicitly, and cloud vs on-prem tradeoffs must be acknowledged.

### Writing Style Rules
Content must be clear, precise, technical, but readable. No marketing language or hype buzzwords without definitions. Use diagrams-friendly explanations and prefer step-by-step mental models over long theory blocks.

### Docusaurus Compatibility
Chapters must be markdown-friendly, headings must be hierarchical and sidebar-ready, code blocks must be copy-paste safe, and no inline HTML unless unavoidable.

## Structural Laws

### Tooling Constraints
The book must explicitly and consistently use: ROS 2 (Humble / Iron), Gazebo, Unity (for visualization), NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS, Jetson Orin devices, and LLMs for planning and conversation (VLA).

### Capstone Integrity Rule
The final capstone must integrate perception, planning, navigation, and manipulation, accept natural language or voice commands, execute actions through ROS 2, and operate in simulation and optionally on real hardware. Partial or toy capstones are not acceptable.

## Writing Laws

### Target Audience Requirements
Content must be suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, AI engineers transitioning into robotics, robotics engineers learning modern AI + LLM integration, and developers building embodied AI systems. Assume readers already know Python, basic machine learning, and linear algebra and calculus fundamentals. Do NOT assume prior knowledge of ROS 2, Gazebo / Unity simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, or humanoid robotics.

### Prohibited Content
No proprietary or leaked code, unsafe robot behaviors, vague "future work" placeholders, or unexplained acronyms.

## Enforcement Rules

### Book Mission
Bridge the gap between digital AI systems and physical embodied intelligence by teaching students how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots that perceive the physical world, understand human language, plan actions, navigate environments, and manipulate objects.

### Compliance Verification
All content must undergo verification to ensure adherence to physical AI first-principles, simulation-to-reality continuity, and modular architecture requirements. Each module must demonstrate clear integration points with previous modules.

## Governance

This constitution defines the non-negotiable principles, scope, structure, and writing rules for an AI-authored technical book built using Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code, Docusaurus, and deployed on GitHub Pages. The constitution ensures that all future content is specification-driven, consistent, modular, and reproducible, and can be safely generated by AI without scope drift. All contributors must follow these rules, and any deviation requires explicit constitutional amendment.
