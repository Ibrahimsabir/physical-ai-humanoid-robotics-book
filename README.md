# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World

This repository contains a comprehensive 13-week curriculum on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, covering everything from ROS 2 fundamentals to Vision-Language-Action systems for autonomous humanoid robots.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into 5 progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Establishing communication infrastructure
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics-based simulation environments
3. **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Perception, navigation, and manipulation
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Natural language to robot action mapping
5. **Module 5: Capstone - Autonomous Humanoid** - Complete system integration
