# Research: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Plan

## Decision: Book Writing Workflow
**Rationale**: The book will be written using a structured, AI-assisted approach that follows the specification-first principle from the constitution. This ensures content aligns with learning objectives and technical requirements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Traditional authoring approach without AI assistance
- Writing content without detailed specifications

## Decision: Docusaurus Framework
**Rationale**: Docusaurus provides excellent support for technical documentation with features like versioning, search, and responsive design. It's ideal for a curriculum-based book with structured modules.

**Alternatives considered**:
- GitBook
- Sphinx
- Custom static site generator

## Decision: Module-Based Structure
**Rationale**: The 5-module structure (ROS 2, Simulation, AI Brain, VLA, Capstone) allows for progressive learning with clear dependencies and boundaries as specified in the book specification.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Chronological approach
- Feature-based organization

## Decision: AI-Assisted Writing Process
**Rationale**: Using Claude Code for content generation ensures consistency, follows specifications precisely, and accelerates the writing process while maintaining technical accuracy.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual writing only
- Other AI tools

## Decision: Quality Gates Implementation
**Rationale**: Multiple validation checkpoints ensure content meets specification requirements, maintains technical accuracy, and follows consistent formatting standards.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Post-completion review only
- Automated checks only
