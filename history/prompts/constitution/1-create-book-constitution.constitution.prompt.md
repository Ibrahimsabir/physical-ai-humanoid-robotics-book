## Prompt

You are an expert curriculum architect, technical author, and Spec-Kit Plus practitioner.

Your task is to generate a **Spec-Kit Plus Constitution file (`constitution.md`)** for a unified AI-driven book project.

## Project Title
Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World

## Purpose of the Constitution
This constitution defines the **non-negotiable principles, scope, structure, and writing rules** for an AI-authored technical book built using:
- Spec-Kit Plus
- Claude Code
- Docusaurus
- Deployed on GitHub Pages

The constitution must ensure that all future content:
- Is **specification-driven**
- Is **consistent, modular, and reproducible**
- Can be safely generated by AI without scope drift

---

## Target Audience
- Advanced undergraduate and graduate students
- AI engineers transitioning into robotics
- Robotics engineers learning modern AI + LLM integration
- Developers building embodied AI systems

Assume readers already know:
- Python
- Basic machine learning
- Linear algebra and calculus fundamentals

Do NOT assume prior knowledge of:
- ROS 2
- Gazebo / Unity simulation
- NVIDIA Isaac
- Humanoid robotics

---

## Book Mission
Bridge the gap between **digital AI systems** and **physical embodied intelligence** by teaching students how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots that:
- Perceive the physical world
- Understand human language
- Plan actions
- Navigate environments
- Manipulate objects

---

## Constitutional Requirements

### 1. Specification-First Rule
- No chapter, section, or example may be written without a corresponding spec.
- Specs define **what must exist**, not how it is implemented.
- Claude must treat specs as authoritative contracts.

### 2. Modular Architecture
The book is divided into modules, each representing a system layer:

- Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid System

Each module must:
- Be self-contained
- Expose clear inputs, outputs, and responsibilities
- Build upon previous modules without duplication

---

### 3. Physical AI First-Principles
All explanations must:
- Respect physical laws (gravity, inertia, latency)
- Explicitly contrast **digital AI vs embodied AI**
- Highlight real-world constraints:
  - Sensor noise
  - Compute limits
  - Latency
  - Energy and hardware tradeoffs

No "magic AI" explanations are allowed.

---

### 4. Simulation-to-Reality Continuity
- Every simulated concept must map to real hardware
- Sim-to-Real transfer must be discussed explicitly
- Cloud vs on-prem tradeoffs must be acknowledged

---

### 5. Writing Style Rules
- Clear, precise, technical, but readable
- No marketing language
- No hype or buzzwords without definitions
- Use diagrams-friendly explanations (even if diagrams are not drawn)
- Prefer step-by-step mental models over long theory blocks

---

### 6. Docusaurus Compatibility
- Chapters must be markdown-friendly
- Headings must be hierarchical and sidebar-ready
- Code blocks must be copy-paste safe
- No inline HTML unless unavoidable

---

### 7. Tooling Constraints
The book must explicitly and consistently use:
- ROS 2 (Humble / Iron)
- Gazebo
- Unity (for visualization)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Jetson Orin devices
- LLMs for planning and conversation (VLA)

---

### 8. Capstone Integrity Rule
The final capstone must:
- Integrate perception, planning, navigation, and manipulation
- Accept natural language or voice commands
- Execute actions through ROS 2
- Operate in simulation and optionally on real hardware

Partial or toy capstones are not acceptable.

---

### 9. Prohibited Content
- No proprietary or leaked code
- No unsafe robot behaviors
- No vague "future work" placeholders
- No unexplained acronyms

---

## Output Requirements
- Output **only** the `constitution.md` content
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Include:
  - Preamble
  - Core Principles
  - Structural Laws
  - Writing Laws
  - Enforcement Rules

Do not explain your reasoning.
Do not include commentary.
Produce the constitution as if it will govern all future AI-generated content.

## Response snapshot

The constitution file was successfully created at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the following content:

- Title: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World Constitution
- Core Principles:
  - Specification-First Rule
  - Modular Architecture
  - Physical AI First-Principles
  - Simulation-to-Reality Continuity
  - Writing Style Rules
  - Docusaurus Compatibility
- Structural Laws:
  - Tooling Constraints
  - Capstone Integrity Rule
- Writing Laws:
  - Target Audience Requirements
  - Prohibited Content
- Enforcement Rules:
  - Book Mission
  - Compliance Verification
- Governance section with version 1.0.0, ratified on 2025-12-17

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete constitution file that governs all future AI-generated content for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now proceed with creating specifications for the book modules
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution establishes clear rules for specification-driven, modular, and physically-grounded AI content that respects real-world constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - constitution properly created with all required sections
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin creating specifications for each book module following the constitution
